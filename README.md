# LLC
LLC is just a UI that uses the command "LeagueClient.exe --locale=[code]" to change the language "without" restrictions.

## Install
Download the application [here](https://github.com/Super99Master/LLC/releases/tag/1.0.0)  
Extract the folder and run the LLC.exe

## Guide
When the app is executed it will check for "League Of Legends" folder (C:\Riot Games\League of Legends)   
If it finds it the circle behind the L is going to be Blue.  
If it doesn't it will be red. Just click ON the L and search for your "League Of Legends" folder.  
  Then click on the LeagueClient.exe and open.  
Then just choose your language and "Apply Language".
This will open League and start downloading the new lang.  
There is no need to open LoL via the program AFTER the first run.  
Sometimes Patch Note do reverse it back to default so you just need to run the program again.
